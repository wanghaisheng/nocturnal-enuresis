What causes enuresis in a child?

Enuresis has many possible causes. The cause of nighttime enuresis often is not known. But possible causes and risk factors may include 1 or more of these:

    Anxiety

    Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)

    Certain genes

    Constipation that puts pressure on the bladder

    Delayed bladder development

    Diabetes

    Not enough antidiuretic hormone (ADH) in the body during sleep

    Obstructive sleep apnea

    Overactive bladder

    Slower physical development

    Small bladder

    Structural problems in the urinary tract

    Trouble feeling that the bladder is full while asleep

    Urinary tract infection

    Very deep sleep

Daytime enuresis may be caused by:

    Anxiety

    Caffeine

    Constipation that puts pressure on the bladder

    Stopping urine stream before finishing (dysfunctional voiding)

    Not going to the bathroom often enough

    Not urinating enough when going

    Overactive bladder

    Small bladder

    Structural problems in the urinary tract

    Urinary tract infection

    Keeping legs too close together traps urine in the vagina and urine leaks out (vaginal voiding)
